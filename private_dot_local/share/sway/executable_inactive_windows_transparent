# This script is a modified version of the one from the link above with

# This script requires i3ipc-python package (install it from a system package
# manager or pip).
# It makes inactive windows transparent. Use `TRANSPARENCY_VALUE` variable to
# control the transparency strength in range of 0…1; 0 is fully transparent.
# The most-recently active window on each monitor stays opaque, not just the
# active window.
