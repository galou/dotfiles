# TODO: make it work under bash
# TODO: use "i3-msg 'exec $executable --class marked-$mark' instead of marks. Then, [class='marked-$mark'] can be used.
#
# Perfoms one of three action:
# - Runs the executable in the scratchpad and show it, if not already running.
# - Shows it if already running and hidden.
# - Hides it if already running and visible.
#
# Dependencies: i3-msg, wmctrl, xprop
#
# This script is a simplified version of
# https://github.com/open-dynaMIX/raiseorlaunch. As of 2018-11-15 with i3 v
# 4.14.1 raiseorlaunch doesn't work with scratchpad and mark (Tested with
# "python3 -m raiseorlaunch -r -d -l 5 -m qalc -c '.*qalculate.*' -e qalculate"
# which doesn't set the mark on first launch.
